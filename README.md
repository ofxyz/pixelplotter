Split colours into primary colors, secondary colors and tertiary colors.


## Roadmap

### Colour

  - Implenent paint colour mixing (RYB)
  - Swatch generators / helper tools. (You can break down colours using tertiary colors of different variety)

### Geometry

  - Implement Cairo render with threading for now. If it turns out to be too slow for prototyping we will need to move to NV_path_rendering.
  - Ability to interpolate shapes

### Pixelate Filter

  - Create pixel class 
      -> Input Colour 
      -> Output colour seperation composition that becomes that colour seen from a large distance.
  - Pixel Designer UI
